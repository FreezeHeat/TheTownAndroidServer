# TheTownAndroidServer
Eclipse project - Server for the android game (Includes web server)

The Town Project is a social game based on the classic game "Werewolf" AKA "Mafia".

Citizens need to stay alive and execute the killer which is on the loose,

the killer on the other hand, needs to use strategy and cunning to kill each and every citizen. 


Features:
* Player match-making - you can play with strangers by rating.
* Friend-list - Add friends which can see your status and join you.
* Rating system - players that are low rank will play with lower ranked players.

NOTE:

There are two projects here, one for the main game server and one for the website (which includes stats for players).

tts - main server
ttws - web server

you can then change your settings in the client to your own server's details.
